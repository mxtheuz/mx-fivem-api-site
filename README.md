# Mx FiveM API Site
This project was built with the aim of managing the players on my FiveM server, but over time, we ended up closing the server so I decided to publish it here. It uses the API that is here on github too. It has a function to take a screenshot of the screen, ban, kick, etc. It's builded with JavaScript.

## How to install
To install this project is very simple. Just follow the steps.

### First step | Installing dependencies
You can install dependencies by

```
npm install
```

or, if you're using Yarn

```
yarn
```

### Second step | Configuration of project
Due to the use of the API, you need to do a little configuration to change the endpoints, etc.

### Third step | Running the project
To run, is very simple too.

```
node app.js
```
